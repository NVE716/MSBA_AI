# MSBA AI Analytics Challenge

This repository contains the code and materials used for the **MSBA AI & Analytics Challenge**.

The challenge was a fast-paced, time-boxed competition where we were given **1 hour and 30 minutes** to:
- Load and explore a new dataset
- Analyze and visualize key patterns
- Develop actionable insights
- Prepare and deliver a short presentation

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook used for data exploration and analysis.
- `presentation/`: Contains the presentation slides summarizing our findings and recommendations.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This was a live challenge completed under time constraints, so the code emphasizes rapid insight generation over production-level polish.
